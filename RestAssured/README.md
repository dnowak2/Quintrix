- TestSuite.java will initiate all of the tests: Vehicle7Test.java, CapacityTest.java, StatusCodeTest.java, and ModelTest.java
- All testing will be completed by running the TestSuite.java file. Each test will access a page of the 
vehicle API using the specific URL, and verify some of the attributes on each page.
